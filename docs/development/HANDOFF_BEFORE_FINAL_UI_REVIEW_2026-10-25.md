# Handoff: full project context for a new session

Read this first. It records what the project is, how the machines and repo are set up, what is built (with measured results), every non-obvious problem we hit and how it was solved, what is in progress, and what comes next. Detailed results per stage are in `findings/`; run instructions are next to the code (`*/README.md`).

---

## 1. The project

IE643 course project (Team InTra): **turn photos/scans of handwritten lecture notes into clean, structured, searchable PDFs.** Official statement: `docs/PROJECT_STATEMENT.md`. Five deliverables: (1) preprocessing, (2) recognition with a fine-tuned vision-language model, (3) structure/layout understanding, (4) digital reconstruction, (5) PDF generation + quality evaluation. Final submission also needs trained models + code docs, a user interface, metrics, and a stage-wise report.

The user (Akshat) owns preprocessing, dataset, reconstruction, PDF and evaluation; a teammate (Ishaan Mane, repo owner) did the original Sauvola binarisation work.

## 2. Repo, branches, machines

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| GitHub repo | `ishaanmane/ie643_project` |
| Working branch (everything) | `akshat/dataset-and-preprocessing` (one branch only; `main` is Ishaan's original; a temporary `preds-sync` branch was deleted) |
| Commit identity | `git -c user.name="Akshat" -c user.email="aksh10.at@gmail.com" commit ...` (no global git identity is set on the Mac) |
| Commit trailer | `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` |
| Mac (laptop) | repo at `/Users/akshatmac/Desktop/IE643/ie643_project`; the Claude session's working directory is `/Users/akshatmac/Desktop/IE643/Project643` (older pre-repo folder with the original dataset build; `Project643/rendered_pdfs/` holds PDFs shown to the user) |
| GPU machine | Ubuntu, RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB (Blackwell, compute 12.0), dual-boot with Windows. User has **terminal access only** (no GUI, laptop cannot reach it over the network). Repo at `/home/intralab/workspace/ie643_project` (171 GB workspace partition). An old unused clone at `~/ie643_project` holds a backup adapter copy; do not delete it blindly |
| GPU env | venv `/home/intralab/ie643/.qwen` (Python 3.13, installs with `uv pip`), HF cache `HF_HOME=/home/intralab/workspace/hf_cache`. Session setup: `source /home/intralab/workspace/ie643_env.sh` (deactivates conda base, activates venv, sets HF_HOME, cd to repo) |
| GPU software | torch cu128, transformers 4.57.6, peft 0.21.2, bitsandbytes 0.50.2, pandoc 3.7, TeX Live 2025 (xelatex), DejaVu fonts, gh CLI logged in as `aksh10-at` (can push) |
| Mac software | Python 3.9 system (no torch); Homebrew; `tectonic` (small LaTeX) and `poppler` installed; a scratch venv with transformers 4.57.6 + CPU torch + pypandoc_binary (pandoc 3.9) lives in an old session scratchpad: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-akshatmac-Desktop-IE643-Project643/7f585ea5-d684-4630-8ef2-6f1e5f84f24d/scratchpad/` (`tenv/` venv, `bin/pandoc` symlink). It may be cleaned by the OS; recreate if missing. Mac disk is tight (~10 GB free) |

### Working rules (agreed with the user)

- **Push only when the user says "push".** Commit locally, then say "say push".
- **The GPU folder never switches branch.** Always `git pull` before starting and before pushing (`git pull -q --rebase && git push -q`). Switching branches once deleted untracked-on-this-branch files (`preds/`).
- **Moving files GPU → Mac goes through git**: GPU commits outputs (`preds/`, `logs/`, `results/pdfs/`) and pushes; the Mac pulls and shows them (Read tool for PDFs, SendUserFile to display). No network path between laptop and GPU (scp/http/ssh failed: hostname does not resolve, not on the same network).
- Give the user copy-paste commands with an **Expect:** line after each, and ask for the output; one step at a time when they are doing setup.
- Long GPU runs inside **tmux** (`tmux new -s qwen` / `tmux attach -t qwen`, detach Ctrl-b d). **Ctrl-C in the training pane kills (and once hung) the run.** Short runs (outline, render) do not need tmux.
- The user dislikes doing things twice and prefers building on the GPU and pulling the result.

## 4. What is done (with numbers)

### 4.1 Dataset (`00_dataset/`, `data/`) — details: `findings/01_dataset.md`
- 410 pages, 4 sources: IE643 chalkboard (205; lecture 2 is low-res 2044x1228, rest 7168x4320), MLT digital ink (129), IE802 notebook (56), HumynLabs CS notes (20). Markdown labels in `data/annotations/<page>.md` (LaTeX `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display, `[Diagram: ...]` for figures). Labels are AI-written (11 via Gemini, 399 by direct transcription) and **not human-verified**.
- Split **by unit** (lecture/week) to avoid near-duplicate leakage: train 318, val 25 (`lec07`, `week06`), test 55 (`lec03`, `lec09`, `week03`, `week09`); 12 pages with `??` are left out of every split until fixed. `build_dataset.py` (lists from `data/raw_scans/`, so it works on a fresh clone), `check_dataset.py` (0 FAIL, 4 known WARN).
- Leakage: highest 5-gram similarity val/test vs train 0.49 (lecture 08 re-derives backprop equations of 07/09).
- Variants built from the same split: `clean` (`data/*.jsonl`), `boxed` (`data/boxed/*.jsonl`, images `data/processed_boxed/` drawn by `02_layout/draw_boxes.py`).
- **Known gap (open decision):** val and test contain **no notebook-photo pages**.

### 4.2 Preprocessing (`01_preprocessing/`) — details: `findings/02_preprocessing.md`
- Page crop/warp → resize 2000 px → illumination flattening → CLAHE → denoise; deskew off by default.
- Five bugs found **only by looking at images** (summary always said 0 failures): skew estimator rotated ~80% of straight pages; page warp cut off chalkboards (skip if mean brightness < 100); tilted photos (aspect < 0.6 rejected); warps covering only 53-72% of the page (minimum area now 0.8); edge clipping (rectangle grown 2%).
- Final: 55 warped (20 HumynLabs + 35 IE802), 355 content-cropped, 0 failures. **The check number for "corrected images" is 55 warped** (old versions had 80 or 62).
- Reproducible on Kaggle, Mac, GPU (same sizes; pixels differ ≤0.5/255; bytes differ, so never compare hashes across machines).

### 4.3 Layout, Surya v2 (`02_layout/`) — details: `findings/03_layout_surya.md`
- Ran on Kaggle T4 (vLLM server). All 410 corrected pages: 4,283 blocks, 0 errors. Raw output `02_layout/surya_results_all.json`; per-page tags `data/tags_draft/` (boxes normalised 0-1000, reading order, type).
- Surya on preprocessed pages beats raw scans (found margin notes, removed neighbouring-page bleed).

### 4.4 Recognition, fine-tuning (`03_recognition/`) — details: `findings/04_recognition_finetuning.md`
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, 4-bit NF4 QLoRA, bf16, LoRA r16/α32 on q,k,v,o,gate,up,down (47.6M params), 318 pages, 3 epochs (120 steps, batch 1×8), lr 1e-4, answer-only loss (masking tested with the real processor). Script `finetune_qwen25vl.py` (also a notebook); data logic `qwen_data.py`.
- Peak VRAM 13.2 GB, ~62 min per run, 31 s/step.
- Validation (25 pages):

| Fine-tuned | CER | WER | text-only CER | equation exact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| zero-shot baseline (boxed_json) | 0.712 | 0.927 | 0.892 | 0.061 |
| `boxed_json` (boxes + layout JSON) | 0.287 | 0.469 | 0.258 | 0.273 |
| **`clean` (chosen)** | **0.277** | 0.485 | **0.222** | 0.244 |

- **Decision: `clean`.** The boxed model dropped side notes Surya had not boxed (65% of label length vs 97-98% for clean on those pages), and clean needs no Surya before Qwen.
- Adapters on the GPU machine: `runs/qwen25vl_clean/final_adapter` (+ backups `/home/intralab/workspace/adapter_clean_<date>/`, `~/ie643_project/adapter_clean_<date>/`), same for `boxed_json`. Predictions committed in `preds/` (`base_*_val`, `lora_*_val`), logs in `logs/`.
- Test split **not scored yet** (labels must be checked first).

### 4.5 Reconstruction + PDF (`04_reconstruction/`)
- **`render_document.py` (deterministic, no model):** per unit, pages in order, blocks copied verbatim; each `[Diagram: ...]` matched to a Surya figure by order-preserving position alignment; over-split Surya figures merged (closest pair first, stop when counts match); unmatched descriptions stay as text; extra drawings added if ≥3% of page; chalkboard crops grayscale-inverted; figures numbered, centred, ≤55% width / 30% height, pinned with `float` `[H]` (otherwise LaTeX moves them); equations checked exactly with xelatex (or tectonic on the Mac) and failing ones shown verbatim with a plain-text warning (never altered); long verbatim lines wrap (fvextra); DejaVu font if present; **reports blocks kept (must be N/N)**.
  - All 42 units with labels: 227/243 diagrams matched (93%), 2,739 equations.
- **`outline.py` (LLM structure only):** Qwen2.5-VL-7B text-only, zero-shot, greedy. Model sees `id | type | first words`, returns section starts/levels. Validation in code: ids exist and increase; levels 1-2; **if a section starts on a heading, the notes' exact heading text is used**; otherwise title words must occur in the notes, else the section break is dropped; repeated consecutive titles merged; outline rejected if more invalid than valid sections (page order then). Parser accepts `{"sections": [...]}` or a bare list, with or without ```json fences; strips `#` from titles; model loaded once.
- Results on val units with model predictions (GPU): lecture 7 15 sections, **91/91 blocks kept**; week 6 5 sections, 37/37; PDFs in `results/pdfs/*_model_outline.pdf`.

### 4.6 Evaluation (`05_evaluation/evaluate.py`)
- CER, WER, text-only CER (math and diagram lines removed), equation exact match; per-page capped at 1.0; references read from `data/annotations/`.

### 4.7 Documentation
- `findings/` (one file per stage + open items), `docs/PIPELINE.md`, `docs/PIPELINE_TO_OCR.md`, `docs/DATASET_AUDIT.md`, stage READMEs.

## 5. Intricacies discovered (read before changing anything)

**Data and preprocessing**
- Look at images, not only summary counts; three preprocessing bugs passed "0 failures".
- Tags must match the exact image Surya saw: `surya_to_tags.py` and `draw_boxes.py` refuse when sizes differ. Check `preprocess_report.csv`: 55 warped = corrected version.
- `data/processed/`, `data/processed_boxed/`, `data/crops/`, `out/` are gitignored and rebuilt per machine (`batch_preprocess.py --workers 8 --force` ~5-8 min, then `draw_boxes.py`).

**Kaggle / Surya**
- Python 3.13 on Kaggle broke `numba`; use uv venvs with Python 3.11. Installing vllm + surya together made the resolver pick vllm 0.1.2: use two venvs. vLLM OOM at start on T4: `--dtype half --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"video": 0}' --max-num-batched-tokens 8192 --enforce-eager`. `pkill -f 'vllm serve'` kills its own shell; kill by GPU pid. `zip` appends to existing archives (`rm -f` first). `git clone` into an existing folder fails silently (old code). Kaggle pins dataset versions. Updating a dataset input restarts the session.

**Fine-tuning**
- The Ollama copy of Qwen cannot be trained; use HF weights.
- `prepare_model_for_kbit_training` wastes ~2 GB VRAM (fp32 upcast); use gradient checkpointing + `enable_input_require_grads`. Generation after training needs `use_cache=True`.
- Pre-resize images to multiples of 28 within the pixel budget so the processor does not resize again (box coordinates then line up).
- Free GPU from Ollama: `ollama stop qwen2.5vl:7b`.

**Rendering / outline**
- Relative `--out` broke pandoc (it runs inside the output folder); fixed with abspath.
- The approximate math check (pandoc parser) misses LaTeX errors (model wrote `&` inside `\text{}`); exact check needs xelatex/tectonic.
- Tectonic stops at the first error; the checker removes the failing equation and retries.
- Inverting a green chalkboard in colour gives pink; grayscale first.
- The model ignores format instructions sometimes (bare list, `#` in titles, a section per page); never trust its output, validate it.
- Model titles differing only in case from the notes' heading lost content (89/91); headings now keep the notes' wording.

**Workflow**
- Laptop cannot reach the GPU machine; transfer via git only. `gh auth login --web` with device code worked for the GPU machine.

## 6. Current state (2026-10-25, after GPU comparisons)

- GPU results pulled through Git: `66e36dc` all-unit annotation reconstruction;
  `cdb2658` actual-prediction plain versus outlined PDF comparison.
- All-unit run: 42 PDFs, 410 pages, 2,579/2,579 intermediate blocks retained,
  41 accepted outlines/384 sections, 227/243 diagrams matched, six diagnosed math
  failures, all XeLaTeX checks completed. IE802 uses page-order fallback.
- IE802 retry is now complete, but fails JSON parsing on unescaped LaTeX commands.
  It proposes 57 sections despite a requested cap of 24. Do not increase tokens again
  as the next fix. See `docs/GENERATION_RUN_REVIEW.md`.
- Reviewed three annotation PDFs. Figure proportions are fixed. Notebook PDF pages
  25 and 29 visibly clip long display equations beyond the right page edge. Some
  glyphs and crops need work. One equation failure (`\bcancel`) needs package support;
  the others concern malformed bracket/ampersand syntax. No semantic repair done.
- Prediction comparison: four PDFs using 25 clean validation predictions; 128/128
  blocks retained in both variants, 9/10 diagram descriptions matched, one invalid
  equation. Lecture 7 grows from 8 to 9 pages with outline; MLT remains 3 pages.
  MLT's outline only promotes one heading level. Lecture outline repeats headings,
  starts a directional-derivative section too early, and adds a Blank Page section.
  See `docs/PREDICTION_COMPARISON_REVIEW.md`.
- **Current recommendation:** plain/page-order rendering as baseline; outline optional.
  No further GPU rerun needed for this comparison. Next accuracy work: equation
  rendering/overflow, missing glyphs, and a small source-checked Surya figure/table
  grounding experiment. Keep trained clean weights; no evidence here for new training.
- All outputs are reconstruction checks or a two-unit ablation, not new recognition
  scores or proof of mathematical correctness. Existing CER result remains unchanged.

### Latest implementation after the comparison

Renderer now supports `cancel`, fits wide display math within the line, records
compiler warnings, and optionally checks PDF word bounds using `pdftotext`.
`--reviewed-fixes` applies an audited K-fold Surya table link and one exact syntax
repair, preserving source predictions and original diagnostics. Thirteen tests pass;
local validation PDFs retain 128/128 blocks, match 10/10 descriptions, and have zero
remaining diagnosed syntax failures. Notebook retains 622/622 blocks; three syntax
failures remain; clipped expressions now fit. See `results/render_fixes_local_validation.md`.
This is curated rendering improvement, not a change in recognition CER.
Next: user-authorized push, GPU pull, then
`bash 04_reconstruction/run_render_fixes.sh --notebook`.
No new model loading/training is needed. Inspect GPU results before claiming parity.

## 7. Next steps (agreed order)

1. Generation measurement (above), then record in `findings/`.
2. Flag uncertain extraction: compare the model's text with Surya's own OCR per block/page (needs a Surya OCR run on Kaggle or the GPU machine); mark disagreeing blocks in the PDF.
3. Cosmetic: attach short label lines next to a figure into its caption ("NP-hard", "local minimum" appear as stray lines); merge sentences split across pages; mark repeated recap content.
4. Later: inference path for new uploads (preprocess → Qwen clean adapter → Surya for figures → outline → render), user interface, layout metric (hand-checked tags on ~20 pages), test-split scoring after label checks, report.

## 8. Open decisions / user tasks
- Hold out notebook-photo pages for val/test (needs code change: IE802 is one unit) or keep the split and note it.
- Fix the 12 `??` pages; check the 55 test labels by hand (`data/VERIFICATION.md`).
- Revoke the Gemini API key pasted in chat early in the project.

## Latest update: upload interface (2026-10-25)

GPU render fixes verified and pulled at `d8beb66`: two validation PDFs retain 128/128 blocks, match 10/10 descriptions with one reviewed link, one syntax repair leaves zero diagnosed failures. Notebook has three remaining syntax fallbacks; all three PDFs have zero out-of-page words.

`06_interface/` adds inference-only clean-adapter processing for new PDFs/images and a stdlib localhost upload UI. No Gradio/Streamlit required. Seven CPU tests pass plus thirteen renderer regressions; simulated recognition with real preprocessing/PDF compilation passes. Real GPU inference is pending. Fresh Surya is not integrated; original scans are appended for checking diagrams. See its README for exact next commands. User confirmed adapter config and 181.6 MiB weights. Current access is Antigravity terminal, similar to SSH; port forwarding is unconfirmed and physical GPU access may be available later. No physical access needed for CLI. Push only on explicit instruction. Submission blockers tracked in `docs/SUBMISSION_READINESS.md`.

### Managed Surya integration update
GPU review artifacts pulled at 0b89236 under results/upload_surya_review. Tested runtime confirmed: Surya 0.22.1 + vLLM 0.32.0, model datalab-to/surya-ocr-2, isolated Python 3.11 environments in /home/intralab/workspace/ie643_layout_envs. Port 8000 belongs to an unrelated Python server; use 8001. Surya 0.7.0 in .qwen is NOT the tested model. Manual reconstruction: 9 matched descriptions + 3 extra figures; two diagrams on source pages 17/19 classified as equations/text; 119 blocks retained; one caption math fallback; 21 PDF pages, zero out-of-page words.
New managed layout module defaults on in CLI/UI; stops only its owned subprocess group, releases previous Qwen before layout. CPU tests pass; managed GPU test pending. Stop manual Surya server before launching updated UI, restart UI Python process, use new application token, retain current cloudflared tunnel. Push still requires explicit instruction.

Managed GPU startup failed because UI PID 353441 retained 7398 MiB, leaving only 8.08 GiB free for Surya's requested 13.93 GiB. Recognition changed to short-lived subprocess per document; UI no longer loads Qwen. CPU worker success/failure/no-CUDA-release tests added. GPU repeat-upload verification pending. One UI restart required after pull; preserve web-tunnel.
